### mp3organizer
Bash script to organize all MP3 files by duration found in the directory where this is executed.

This is my first bash script.

I tried solving this with Python and even PowerShell, but for some reason, they gave me weird permission errors, and not all MP3 files were detected properly.

I have not had the opportunity to test this script to make it more robust, but it successfully sorted more than 1000 MP3 files of all kinds with no errors.

For some reason, it's not as fast as I thought, but at least it's better than doing it manually.

You need to have FFmpeg installed to run this script.
I used [Ubuntu Mate](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) 22.04.2 LTS.
To install [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) on Debian-based distros, you can use the following command:
`sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
